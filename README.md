#### 🛠️ Important Notes
The repository does not include the following essential files:
1. Database Initialization: The file responsible for setting up and initializing the database is missing. You will need to create or provide this file to use the bot.
2. Images Folder: The folder containing avatar images, including race, class, and gender assets, is not included. Ensure you add these images in the appropriate directory structure.
